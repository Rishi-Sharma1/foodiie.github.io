		<h3>Tofu has got to be my ultimate favorite protein. Healthy, quick, convenient, and so easy to keep multiple packages in the fridge. I’ve loved tofu forever and now that Mike is a total tofu convert, it’s a big part of our meal plans!
		
		I love tofu so much that I will eat it straight out of the package with just a touch of really good soy sauce and a huge pile of thinly sliced scallions. If I’m feeling like a sweet, savory, garlicky, crispy snack I’ll make these honey garlic tofu bites. Quick, easy, and so satisfying. Pair them with some fluffy rice or whole grains and greens for a honey garlic tofu bowl and live your best life.</h3><br>
		<h1>How to press tofu</h1>
		<h4>Pressing tofu gets all the excess liquid out and makes it easier to crisp up. It also makes the tofu more dense and chewy. It’s a super simple step. If you’re using extra firm tofu, you can skip this step and just pat the tofu dry.<br>
		</h4>
		1.Open and drain the tofu, then fold up a clean tea towel or paper towels so they’re roughly the same shape as the tofu.<br>
		2.Place the towels on a cutting board or plate and put the tofu on top. Top with another layer of folded towels.<br>
		3.Place a second cutting board or plate on top and weight it down with a heavy bowl. Let sit for 15-30 minutes, changing the paper towels if needed.<br>
		4.Use the tofu in your recipe!<br>
