		<h3>We love our Instant Pot! It’s the best in class for set it and forget it dinners. Here are our best Instant Pot recipes, the ones we turn to again and again.</h3><br>
		
		Instant Pots take time to come up to pressure, but the best thing about them is once everything is inside, you don’t need to baby it. Forget monitoring the temperature or flipping things, just pop everything in, wait, and eat!<br><br>

		<h1>Instant Pot Butter Chicken</h1>

        <h3>Butter chicken doesn’t need much of an introduction. It’s a creamy chicken curry made with tomatoes, spices, butter and cream. This particular butter chicken is full of flavor, just a touch of heat, and the right amount of cream. It comes together so quickly and it’s the perfect cozy home cooked meal.</h3>
        <h1>Instant Pot Thai red curry ramen</h1>
        <img src="15-min-curry-ramen-5793w (1).jpg" height="500" width="800" align="center"><br><br>
        <h3>A super simple satisfying weeknight dinner full of flavor, lean protein, vegetables, and noodles. This soup is packed with flavor from the curry and sesame, giving you a creamy, nutty soup that hits all the right flavor notes. I especially love the mushrooms. Don’t worry if the coconut milk “breaks” in the Instant Pot – you want it too, it’s how they make curries in Thailand and Malaysia and it’s a sign of a good curry :)</h3>
